============

This reference implementation has been tested on Mac OS X, Linux, and 
OpenBSD.  There are a number of steps to follow to get it going, but 
they work.  

It is hoped that folks will contribute enhancements where things can
be improved...


Steps:


1. build the "rsshd" daemon

   # cd network-element
   # more INSTALL.txt


2. build the "SimpleNMS" class

   # cd management-server
   # more INSTALL.txt


3. create certificate authority

   # cd certificate-authority
   # make


4. generate network-element's private key and certificate signing request
   
   # cd network-element
   # make cert_request

   - notice that the device's unique-identifier is in the CN field
     of the certificate request


5. have CA sign the device's certificate signing request

   # cd certificate-authority
   # make sign_request

     - this will prompt you for the pathname to the certificate request
     - you can enter "../network-element/cert_request.pem"
     - which will cause it to save "../network-element/signed_cert.pem"


6. create device's SSH X.509-based hostkey

   # cd network-element
   # make ssh_hostkey


7. copy CA's cert to management-server

   # cd management-server
   # cp ../certificate-authority/public/trusted_ca_cert.pem .

      - note: this is the same name as configured in the config.prop file


8. (OPTIONAL) generate a key-pair for user-auth

   This implementation can either log into devices using password or
   a key-pair.  If both are configured, but only password succeeds,
   `ncchd` will try to save the management-server's public key into the
   network-element's account's .ssh/authorized_keys file.

   # cd management-server    (in case you're not still there)
   # ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -N "" -f id_rsa >> /dev/null

      - notes:
         - will also create id_rsa.pub
         - id_rsa is the filename as configured in the config.prop file


9. (OPTIONAL) create an account for the management-server to log into

    The management-server log into any user-account configured on the 
    network-element, so long is the account's username and password
    are set correctly in its config.prop file.

    I've been creating accounts called "admin" with password "abc123",
    which are the values you'll see in the current config.prop file.


10. Run demo

   The order of execution does not matter but, to simulate a normal
   production environment, the management-server would already be
   running and the network-element would stand-up later, so:

   In one window:

       # cd management-server
       # make run

         ^C when you've seen enough

   In another window:

       # cd network-element
       # make run

         ^C when you've seen enough
