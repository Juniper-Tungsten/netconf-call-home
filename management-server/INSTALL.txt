# These instructions compile the SimpleNMS class for the management-server
# half of NETCONF Call Home connection.  This code uses X.509 certificates,
# as is recommended by the Call Home draft (draft-ietf-netconf-call-home-17).


1. Get the most recent stable J2SSH Maverick library

   Warning: this is a commercial product, but has a free 6-week eval
            license.  This Java-based SSH library is known to support
            X.509 certificates.  If you don't care about X.509 and
            don't want to purchase a license, the older J2SSH (not
            Maverick) code is still available.

   Main site: https://www.sshtools.com/en/products/j2ssh

       # cd management-server/    // in case you're not already

       - use a web browser to download to latest (e.g. 1.6.20)
       - unzip the download into the management-server directory
       - this should result in a directory like:

          management-server/maverick-legacy-client-1.6.20

       # rm maverick.zip  // don't need this anymore



2. Get an evaluation license for the J2SSH Maverick library

   Main site: https://www.sshtools.com/en/products/j2ssh

   Example:

       # cd management-server/    // in case you're not already

       - use a web browser to download an evaluation license
       - place the license file into the maverick directory:

          maverick-legacy-client-1.6.20/license.txt

       - be sure to use this file name, `make run` depends on it



3. Get the the latest SFL4J package (Simple Logging Facade for Java)

   Main site: http://www.slf4j.org

   Example:

       # cd management-server/    // in case you're not already
       # curl -O http://www.slf4j.org/dist/slf4j-1.7.20.tar.gz
       # tar -xzvf slf4j-1.7.20.tar.gz
       # rm slf4j-1.7.20.tar.gz   // don't need this anymore


3. Compile the "SimpleNMS" class

   Example:

       # make



4. Test-run

       # make run

       This will just print out that it is waiting to accept a
       connection.

       ^C when you've seen enough
