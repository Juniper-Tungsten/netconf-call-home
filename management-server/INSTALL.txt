# These instructions compile the SimpleNMS class for the management-server's
# half of a NETCONF Call-Home connection.  This code uses X.509 certificates,
# as is recommended by the Reverse SSH draft (draft-ietf-netconf-reverse-ssh).


1. Get the most recent stable J2SSH Maverick library

   Warning: this is a commercial product, but has a free 6-week eval
            license.  This is the *only* Java-based SSH library known
            to support X.509 certificates.  If you don't care about
            X.509 and don't want to purchase a license, the older
            J2SSH (not Maverick) code is still available.

   Main site: http://www.sshtools.com/products/j2ssh-maverick

   Example:  ('\' added for formatting only)

       # cd management-server/    // in case you're not already

       - use a web broswer to download to latest (e.g. 1.6.1)
       - unzip the download into the management-server directory
       - this should result in a directory like:

          management-server/maverick-legacy-client-1.6.1-professional

       # rm maverick-legacy-client-1.6.1-professiona.zip  // don't need this anymore



2. Get an evaluation license for the J2SSH Maverick library

   Main site: http://www.sshtools.com/products/j2ssh-maverick

   Example:

       # cd management-server/    // in case you're not already

       - use a web broswer to download an evaluation license
       - place the resulting license.txt file into the maverick directory:

          maverick-legacy-client-1.6.1-professional/license.txt



3. Get the the latest SFL4J package

   Main site: http://www.slf4j.org

   Example:

       # cd management-server/    // in case you're not already
       # curl http://www.slf4j.org/dist/slf4j-1.7.6.tar.gz -o slf4j-1.7.6.tar.gz
       # tar -xzvf slf4j-1.7.6.tar.gz
       # rm slf4j-1.7.6.tar.gz   // don't need this anymore

3. Compile the "SimpleNMS" class

   Example:

       # make



4. Test-run

       # make run

       This will just print out that it is waiting to accept a
       connection.

       ^C when you've seen enough
