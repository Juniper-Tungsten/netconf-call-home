The psuedocode for the SimpleNMS is as follows:

  - read properties file specified by command line
  - listen for connections on port specified in the properties file
  - for each connection, spawn a thread that runs the DeviceHandler class 
      - start ssh connection using socket accepted by main()
      - authenticate device's host key signed by trusted CA (in prop file)
      - log into device using specified username
          - first try to auth using a private key
          - next try to auth using a password
      - start NETCONF subsystem
      - send <hello>
      - if auth using private key failed, set private key on device
      - send <close-session>


Opportunities for improvement:
  - have more than one instance of NMS running (test fail over)
  - bug on Mac OS X platform: password-auth used to work, but now doesn't?
